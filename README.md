# hyper-sdk

A Software Development Kit for the [hypercore-protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org/)

Formerly known as "dat-sdk".

## Why use this?

Hypercore-protocol and it's ecosystem consists of a bunch of low level building blocks for working with data in distributed applications. Although this modularity makes it easy to mix and match pieces, it adds complexity when it comes to actually building something.

The Hyper SDK combines the lower level pieces of the Hyper stack into high level APIs that you can use across platforms so that you can focus on your application rather than the gritty details of how it works.

The Hyper SDK can either work "natively", which means the full storage and networking stack runs directly within the SDK. Alternatively, it supports the experimental [hyperspace](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hyperspace) daemon. In this mode, the SDK needs a hyperspace daemon running and will connect to it as a client.

## Goals

- High level API
- Cross-platform with same codebase
  - ✔ Node
  - ✔ Web
  - ✔ Electron
  - React-Native (with [nodejs-mobile-react-native?](https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile-react-native))

## Watch the workshop [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyHk4aImd_I&list=PL7sG5SCUNyeYx8wnfMOUpsh7rM_g0w_cu&index=20). Try it yourself: [workshop](https://github.com/RangerMauve/dat-workshop)

## Installing Node

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) / [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) workflows:

```shell
npm install --save hyper-sdk
```

```js
const SDK = require('hyper-sdk')
```

## Building a bundle for Browsers

The easiest way to get started is to run the `build` command in this `sdk`, then copy the `bundle.js` into your own project. Here's how:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:datproject/sdk.git

cd sdk

# Compile the SDK into a single JS file
npm run build

# Copy `hyper-sdk-bundle.js` into your project
```

```html
<script src="hyper-sdk-bundle.js"></script>
<script>
  const SDK = window.hyperSDK
  // Look at the examples from here
</script>
```

## Compile with Browserify

If the bundle above doesn't work for your setup, and you want to DIY in your own project, you'll need to mimic how the SDK generates the bundle, using:

- [x] Browserify
- [x] Babelify (babel for browserify)
- [x] babel.config.json file

Combine [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (via [Babelify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babelify)) to make this work in the browser:

**Dev** Dependencies (*must* be a DevDependency):

```
npm install --save-dev browserify babelify util
```
and the regular dependencies
```
npm install --save hyper-sdk@latest @geut/sodium-javascript-plus hyperswarm-web
```

Add this as the `build` command in your `package.json`. It is important to add the transform (`-t`) with `babelify` to make it work. Babel will use the aliases in the [babel.config.json](https://github.com/datproject/sdk/blob/master/babel.config.json) file to change the code from nodejs to browser.

```shell
"build": "browserify -t [ babelify --global ] index.js > bundle.js"
```

Once you `npm run build` then you can use the generated `bundle.js` in your project!

## Compile with Webpack (webpack.config.js)

To bundle with webpack, you'll need to alias some dependencies.

```js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  entry: './index.js',
  target: 'web',
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      fs: 'graceful-fs',
      hyperswarm: 'hyperswarm-web',
      util: './node_modules/util/util.js'
    }
  },
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
}
```

Then you can include `./dist/bundle.js` in your HTML page.

## API/Examples

```js
const SDK = require('hyper-sdk')

const sdk = await SDK({
  // With this, all drive will disappear after the process exits
  // This is here so that running the example doesn't clog up your history
  persist: false,
  // storage can be set to an instance of `random-access-*`
  // const RAI = require('random-access-idb')
  // otherwise it defaults to `random-access-web` in the browser
  // and `random-access-file` in node
  storage: null  //storage: RAI
});

const {
	Hypercore,
	Hyperdrive,
	resolveName,
  resolveURL,
	close
} = sdk

// Create a new Hyperdrive.
// If you want to create a new drive, pass in a name for it
// This will be used to derive a secret key
// Every time you open a drive with that name it'll derive the same key
// This uses a master key that's generated once per device
// That means the same name will yield a different key on a different machine
const drive = Hyperdrive('My drive name')

// You should wait for the drive to be totally initialized
await drive.ready()

const url = `hyper://${drive.key.toString('hex')}`

// TODO: Save this for later!
console.log(`Here's your URL: ${url}`)

// Check out the hyperdrive docs for what you can do with it
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperdrive#api
await drive.writeFile('/example.txt', 'Hello World!')
console.log('Written example file!')

const key = await resolveName('blog.mauve.moe')
const drive = Hyperdrive(key)
await drive.download()

// Delete all the data
await drive.destroyStorage()

const SOME_URL = 'dat://0a9e202b8055721bd2bc93b3c9bbc03efdbda9cfee91f01a123fdeaadeba303e/'

const somedrive = Hyperdrive(SOME_URL)

console.log(await somedrive.readdir('/'))

// Create a hypercore
// Check out the hypercore docs for what you can do with it
// https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore
const myCore = Hypercore('my hypercore name', {
  valueEncoding: 'json',
  persist: false,
  // storage can be set to an instance of `random-access-*`
  // const RAI = require('random-access-idb')
  // otherwise it defaults to `random-access-web` in the browser
  // and `random-access-file` in node
  storage: null  // storage: RAI
})

// Add some data to it
await myCore.append(JSON.stringify({
  name: 'Alice'
}))

// Use extension messages for sending extra data over the p2p connection
const discoveryCoreKey = 'dat://bee80ff3a4ee5e727dc44197cb9d25bf8f19d50b0f3ad2984cfe5b7d14e75de7'
const discoveryCore = new Hypercore(discoveryCoreKey)

// Register the extension message handler
const extension = discoveryCore.registerExtension('discovery', {
	// Set the encoding type for messages
	encoding: 'binary',
	onmessage: (message, peer) => {
		// Recieved messages will be automatically decoded
		console.log('Got key from peer!', message)

		const otherCore = new Hypercore(message, {
      valueEncoding: 'json',
      persist: false
    })

    // Render the peer's data from their core
    otherCore.get(0, console.log)
	}
})

// When you find a peer tell them about your core
discoveryCore.on('peer-add', (peer) => {
	console.log('Got a peer!')
	extension.send(myCore.key, peer)
})

const hypertrie = require('hypertrie')

// Pass in hypercores from the SDK into other data structures
// Check out what you can do with hypertrie from there:
// https://github.com/mafintosh/hypertrie
const trie = hypertrie(null, {
  feed: new Hypercore('my trie core', {
    persist: false
  })
})

trie.put('key', 'value', () => {
  trie.get('key', (err, node) => {
    console.log('Got key: ', node.key)
    console.log('Loaded value from trie: ', node.value)
  })
})

```

## Running tests

All available tests are run three times: For the native backend, for the hyperspace backend, and with one native and one hyperspace backend.

To run tests in Node.js simply run `npm run test` in a checkout.

To run the tests in a browser, simply run `npm run test-browser` to build the test bundle. It will run several things in parallel.

## API

The API supports both promises and callbacks. Everywhere where you see `await`, you can instead pass a node-style callback.

### const SDK = require('hyper-sdk')

Import the SDK contructor using the *native* backend. This means that the full storage and networking stack runs right within the current process. Works both in Node.js and in web browsers.

When running in a web browser, it needs a [hyperswarm-web](https://github.com/RangerMauve/hyperswarm-web) proxy for peer to peer connectivity.

### const SDK = require('hyper-sdk/hyperspace')

Import the SDK contructor using the experimental *hyperspace* backend. Here, the SDK needs a running hyperspace server.

When running in NodeJS, this will attempt to connect to a hyperspace server running on the same machine. When running in a web browser, this will attempt to connect to a Hyperspace server over Websockets (experimental).

*TODO:* Document how to run a Websocket Hyperspace server.

*NOTE:* The *hyperspace* backend does not yet support the `deriveSecret` function (will throw an exception if used).

### `const {Hypercore, Hyperdrive, resolveName, resolveURL, keyPair, deriveSecret, registerExtension, close} = await SDK(opts?)`

Creates an instance of the Hyper SDK based on the options.

Options for the *native* backend:

- `opts.applicationName`: An optional name for the application using the SDK. This will automatically silo your data from other applications using the SDK and will store it in the appropriate place using [random-access-application](https://github.com/RangerMauve/random-access-application/)
- `opts.persist: true`: An optional arg for whether data should be persisted. Set this to `false` if you want stuff stored in memory. Ignored if you pass in a custom storage or corestore.
- `opts.storage`: An optional [random-access-storage](https://github.com/random-access-storage/random-access-storage) instance for storing data
- `opts.swarmOpts`: This lets you configure [hyperswarm](https://github.com/hyperswarm/hyperswarm) and [hyperswarm-web](https://github.com/RangerMauve/hyperswarm-web)
  - `maxPeers`: The maximum number of connections to keep for this swarm.
  - `ephemeral **Node**`: Set to `false` if this is going to be in a long running process on a server.
  - `bootstap **Node**`: An array of addresses to use for the DHT bootstraping. Defaults to `['bootstrap1.hyperdht.org:49737', 'bootstrap2.hyperdht.org:49737', 'bootstrap3.hyperdht.org:49737']`
  - `preferredPort: 42666 **Node**`: The port hyperswarm should try to bind on. You should allow it through your firewall on TCP/UDP for best results.
  - `webrtcBootstrap **Browser**: ['https://geut-webrtc-signal.herokuapp.com/'] **BROWSER**`: The WebRTC bootstrap server list used by [discovery-swarm-webrtc](https://github.com/geut/discovery-swarm-webrtc)
  - `wsProxy **Browser**: 'wss://hyperswarm.mauve.moe' **BROWSER**`: The Websocket proxy used for [hyperswarm-proxy-ws](https://github.com/RangerMauve/hyperswarm-proxy-ws)

Options for the *hyperspace* backend:

- `opts.hyperspaceOpts` Options to initialize the connection to a hyperspace server.
    - `client`: An optional [@hyperspace/client](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hyperspace-client) instance. If not set a client will be created automatically.
    - `protocol`: The protocol to use. Defaults to `ws` in browsers and `uds` in Node.js.
    - `port`: If using the `ws` protocol: Port of the Websocket to connect to (default `9000`)
    - `host`: For `ws` protocol: Hostname of the Websocket to connect to (default `localhost`). For `uds` protocol: Name of the socket (default `hyperspace`).

Options for all backends:

- `opts.corestore`: An optional [Corestore](https://github.com/andrewosh/corestore) instance for using as hypercore storage.
- `opts.corestoreOpts`: Options to pass into Corestore when it's initialized.
  - `masterKey`: Optional 32 byte Buffer with the master key that should be used to derive sercret keys for hypercores. Useful to restore from backups
  - `ack`: Whether you want there to be a `peer-ack` event emitted when data has been uploaded to a peer.
- `opts.coreOpts`: This lets you configure the behavior of [Hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore) instances
  - `sparse: true`: Whether the history should be loaded on the fly instead of replicating the full history
  - `valueEncoding: 'json' | 'utf-8' | 'binary'`: The encoding to use for the data stored in the hypercore. Use JSON to store / retrieve objects.
- `opts.driveOpts`: This lets you configure the behavior of [Hyperdrive](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive) instances
  - `sparse: true`: Whether the history should be loaded on the fly instead of replicating the full history

### `await close()`

This closes all resources used by the SDK so you can safely end your process. `cb` will be invoked once resources are closed or if there's an error.

### `const key = await resolveName(name[, opts])`

Resolve a DNS name to a Hypercore key.

  - `name` is a domain name URL like `blog.mauve.moe`
  - `opts`: See `hyper-dns` [options for `resolveProtocol`][resolve-opts]
  - `key` will be the key that you can pass to `Hyperdrive`

[resolve-opts]: https://github.com/martinheidegger/hyper-dns/blob/main/docs/api.md#async-resolveprotocolprotocol-name-opts

### `const url = await resolveURL(href[, opts])`

Resolves a hyper url to a Hypercore url.

  - `href` is the url to be resolve, like `hyper://blog.mauve.moe` or `blog.mauve.moe/fancy`
  - `opts`: See `hyper-dns` [options for `resolveURL`][resolve-url-opts]

[resolve-url-opts]: https://github.com/martinheidegger/hyper-dns/blob/main/docs/api.md#async-resolveurlurl-opts

### `const {publicKey, secretKey} = keyPair`

This gives you the public / private keypair used for the Noise protocol encryption when connecting to peers.
You can use this to identify peers in the network using `peer.remotePublicKey`

### `const secret = await deriveSecret(namespace, name)`

Derives a secret key based on the SDK's master key.
`namespace` can be used to namespace different applications, and `name` is the name of the key you want.
This can be used as a seed for generating secure private keys without needing to store an extra key on disk.
This function is currently only supported in the native backend.

### `const extension = registerExtension(name, handlers)`

Listens on extension messages of type `name` on the feeds replication channels.

- `handlers.encoding`: The encoding to use for messages. `json`, `binary`, 'utf8'
- `handlers.onmessage(message, peer)`: Function to invoke when a peer sends you a message for this extension type.
- `handlers.onerror(err, peer)`: Function to invoke when a peer has sent you a mis-coded message on this extension.

You can respond to messages with `extension.send(message, peer)`.
You can also broadcast out messages to all peers with `extension.broadcast(message)`

### `const drive = Hyperdrive(keyOrName, opts)`

This initializes a Hyperdrive, the SDK will begin finding peers for it and will de-duplicate calls to initializing the same drive more than once.

- `keyOrName`: This **must** be provided. It's either a `hyper://` URL / key or a string identifying the name. If you want to have a writable drive, you can use the name to generate one and use the name later to get the same drive back without having to save the key somewhere.
- `opts`: These are the options for configuring the hyperdrive.
  - `sparse: true`: Whether the history should be loaded on the fly instead of replicating the full history
  - `secretKey`: A secret key for granting write access. This can be useful when restoring backups.
	- `discoveryKey`: Optionally specify which discovery key you'd like to use for finding peers for this drive.
	- `lookup: true`: Specify whether you wish to lookup peers for this drive. Set `false` along with `announce` to avoid advertising
	- `announce: true`: Specify whether you wish to advertise yourself as having the drive.

The rest of the Hyperdrive docs were taken from the [Hyperdrive README](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive/blob/v9/README.md). Note that we're wrapping over the APIs with [Hyperdrive-Promise](https://github.com/geut/hyperdrive-promise) so any callback methods can be `await`ed instead.

#### `drive.version`

Get the current version of the drive (incrementing number).

#### `drive.key`

The public key identifying the drive.

#### `drive.discoveryKey`

A key derived from the public key that can be used to discovery other peers sharing this drive.

#### `drive.writable`

A boolean indicating whether the drive is writable.

#### `drive.on('ready')`

Emitted when the drive is fully ready and all properties has been populated.

#### `drive.on('update')`

Emitted when the drive has got a new change.

#### `drive.on('error', err)`

Emitted when a critical error during load happened.

#### `drive.on('close')`

Emitted when the drive has been closed

#### `drive.on('peer-add', peer)`

Emitted when a new peer has started replicating wiht the drive.

#### `drive.on('peer-remove', peer)`

Emitted when a peer has stopped replicating wit the drive.

#### `var oldDrive = drive.checkout(version, [opts])`

Checkout a readonly copy of the drive at an old version. Options are used to configure the `oldDrive`:

```js
{
  metadataStorageCacheSize: 65536 // how many entries to use in the metadata hypercore's LRU cache
  contentStorageCacheSize: 65536 // how many entries to use in the content hypercore's LRU cache
  treeCacheSize: 65536 // how many entries to use in the append-tree's LRU cache
}
```

#### `await drive.download([path])`

Download all files in path of current version.
If no path is specified this will download all files.

You can use this with `.checkout(version)` to download a specific version of the drive.

``` js
drive.checkout(version).download()
```

#### `await drive.clear(path)`

Clear the storage of all files in the path.
This is the opposite of the `download` API.
Note that this doesn't delete the files from history, just clears the data locally.

You can use this with `.checkout(version)` to clear a specific version of the drive.

#### `var stream = drive.history([options])`

Get a stream of all changes and their versions from this drive.

#### `var stream = drive.createReadStream(name, [options])`

Read a file out as a stream. Similar to fs.createReadStream.

Options include:

``` js
{
  start: optionalByteOffset, // similar to fs
  end: optionalInclusiveByteEndOffset, // similar to fs
  length: optionalByteLength
}
```

#### `const data = await drive.readFile(name, [options])`

Read an entire file into memory. Similar to fs.readFile.

Options can either be an object or a string

Options include:
```js
{
  encoding: string
  cached: true|false // default: false
}
```
or a string can be passed as options to simply set the encoding - similar to fs.

If `cached` is set to `true`, this function returns results only if they have already been downloaded.

#### `var stream = drive.createDiffStream(version, [options])`

Diff this drive with another version. `version` can both be a version number of a checkout instance of the drive. The `data` objects looks like this

``` js
{
  type: 'put' | 'del',
  name: '/some/path/name.txt',
  value: {
    // the stat object
  }
}
```

#### `var stream = drive.createWriteStream(name, [options])`

Write a file as a stream. Similar to fs.createWriteStream.
If `options.cached` is set to `true`, this function returns results only if they have already been downloaded.

#### `await drive.writeFile(name, buffer, [options])`

Write a file from a single buffer. Similar to fs.writeFile.

#### `await drive.unlink(name)`

Unlinks (deletes) a file. Similar to fs.unlink.

#### `await drive.mkdir(name, [options])`

Explictly create an directory. Similar to fs.mkdir

#### `await drive.rmdir(name)`

Delete an empty directory. Similar to fs.rmdir.

#### `const names = await drive.readdir(name, [options])`

Lists a directory. Similar to fs.readdir.

Options include:

``` js
{
    cached: true|false, // default: false
}
```

If `cached` is set to `true`, this function returns results from the local version of the drive’s append-tree. Default behavior is to fetch the latest remote version of the drive before returning list of directories.

#### `const stat = await drive.stat(name, [options])`

Stat an entry. Similar to fs.stat. Sample output:

```
Stat {
  dev: 0,
  nlink: 1,
  rdev: 0,
  blksize: 0,
  ino: 0,
  mode: 16877,
  uid: 0,
  gid: 0,
  size: 0,
  offset: 0,
  blocks: 0,
  atime: 2017-04-10T18:59:00.147Z,
  mtime: 2017-04-10T18:59:00.147Z,
  ctime: 2017-04-10T18:59:00.147Z,
  linkname: undefined }
```

The output object includes methods similar to fs.stat:

``` js
var stat = drive.stat('/hello.txt')
stat.isDirectory()
stat.isFile()
```

Options include:
```js
{
  cached: true|false // default: false,
  wait: true|false // default: true
}
```

If `cached` is set to `true`, this function returns results only if they have already been downloaded.

If `wait` is set to `true`, this function will wait for data to be downloaded. If false, will return an error.

#### `await drive.lstat(name, [options])`

Stat an entry but do not follow symlinks. Similar to fs.lstat.

Options include:
```js
{
  cached: true|false // default: false,
  wait: true|false // default: true
}
```

If `cached` is set to `true`, this function returns results only if they have already been downloaded.

If `wait` is set to `true`, this function will wait for data to be downloaded. If false, will return an error.

#### `await drive.access(name, [options])`

Similar to fs.access.

Options include:
```js
{
  cached: true|false // default: false,
  wait: true|false // default: true
}
```

If `cached` is set to `true`, this function returns results only if they have already been downloaded.

If `wait` is set to `true`, this function will wait for data to be downloaded. If false, will return an error.

#### `const fd = await drive.open(name, flags, [mode])`

Open a file and get a file descriptor back. Similar to fs.open.

Note that currently only read mode is supported in this API.

#### `await drive.read(fd, buf, offset, len, position)`

Read from a file descriptor into a buffer. Similar to fs.read.

#### `await drive.close(fd)`

Close a file. Similar to fs.close.

#### `await drive.close()`

Closes all open resources used by the drive.
The drive should no longer be used after calling this.
If you load this hyperdrive's key more than once at once, `close()` will be a noop until all handles invoke it.

#### `await drive.destroyStorage()`

Closes all resources used by the drive, and destroys its data from storage.
The drive should no longer be used after calling this.

### `const feed = Hypercore(keyOrName, opts)`

Initializes a Hypercore (aka Feed) and begins replicating it.

- `keyOrName`: This **must** be provided. It's either a `hyper://` URL / key or a string identifying the name of the feed. If you want to have a writable feed, you can use the name to generate one and use the name later to get the same feed back without having to save the key somewhere.
- `opts`: The options for configuring this feed
  - `sparse: true`: Whether the history should be loaded on the fly instead of replicating the full history
  - `valueEncoding: 'json' | 'utf-8' | 'binary'`: The encoding to use for the data stored in the hypercore. Use JSON to store / retrieve objects.
  - `secretKey`: The secret key to use for the feed. Useful for restoring from backups.
	- `discoveryKey`: Optionally specify which discovery key you'd like to use for finding peers for this feed.
	- `lookup: true`: Specify whether you wish to lookup peers for this feed. Set to `false` along with `announce` to avoid advertising.
	- `announce: true`: Specify whether you wish to advertise yourself as having the feed.

#### `const seq = await feed.append(data)`

Append a block of data to the feed.

Callback is called with `(err, seq)` when all data has been written at the returned `seq` or an error occurred.

#### `const data = await feed.get(index, [options])`

Get a block of data.
If the data is not available locally this method will prioritize and wait for the data to be downloaded before calling the callback.

Options include

``` js
{
  wait: true, // wait for index to be downloaded
  timeout: 0, // wait at max some milliseconds (0 means no timeout)
  valueEncoding: 'json' | 'utf-8' | 'binary' // defaults to the feed's valueEncoding
}
```

Callback is called with `(err, data)`

#### `const results = await feed.getBatch(start, end, [options])`

Get a range of blocks efficiently. Options include

``` js
{
  wait: sameAsAbove,
  timeout: sameAsAbove,
  valueEncoding: sameAsAbove
}
```

#### `const data = await feed.head([options])`

Get the block of data at the tip of the feed. This will be the most recently
appended block.

Accepts the same `options` as `feed.get()`.

#### `await feed.download([range])`

Download a range of data. Callback is called when all data has been downloaded.
A range can have the following properties:

``` js
{
  start: startIndex,
  end: nonInclusiveEndIndex,
  linear: false // download range linearly and not randomly
}
```

If you do not mark a range the entire feed will be marked for download.

If you have not enabled sparse mode (`sparse: true` in the feed constructor) then the entire
feed will be marked for download for you when the feed is created.

#### `await feed.undownload(range)`

Cancel a previous download request.

#### `const signature = await feed.signature([index])`

Get a signature proving the correctness of the block at index, or the whole stream.

Callback is called with `(err, signature)`.
The signature has the following properties:
``` js
{
  index: lastSignedBlock,
  signature: Buffer
}
```

#### `const success = await feed.verify(index, signature)`

Verify a signature is correct for the data up to index, which must be the last signed
block associated with the signature.

Callback is called with `(err, success)` where success is true only if the signature is
correct.

#### `const roots = await feed.rootHashes(index)`

Retrieve the root *hashes* for given `index`.

Callback is called with `(err, roots)`; `roots` is an *Array* of *Node* objects:
```
Node {
  index: location in the merkle tree of this root
  size: total bytes in children of this root
  hash: hash of the children of this root (32-byte buffer)
}
```


#### `var number = feed.downloaded([start], [end])`

Returns total number of downloaded blocks within range.
If `end` is not specified it will default to the total number of blocks.
If `start` is not specified it will default to 0.

#### `var bool = feed.has(index)`

Return true if a data block is available locally.
False otherwise.

#### `var bool = feed.has(start, end)`
Return true if all data blocks within a range are available locally.
False otherwise.

#### `await feed.clear(start, [end])`

Clear a range of data from the local cache.
Will clear the data from the bitfield and make a call to the underlying storage provider to delete the byte range the range occupies.

`end` defaults to `start + 1`.

#### `feed.seek(byteOffset, callback)`

Seek to a byte offset.

Calls the callback with `(err, index, relativeOffset)`, where `index` is the data block the byteOffset is contained in and `relativeOffset` is
the relative byte offset in the data block.

#### `await feed.update([minLength])`

Wait for the feed to contain at least `minLength` elements.
If you do not provide `minLength` it will be set to current length + 1.

Does not download any data from peers except for a proof of the new feed length.

``` js
console.log('length is', feed.length)
feed.update(function () {
  console.log('length has increased', feed.length)
})
```

#### `var stream = feed.createReadStream([options])`

Create a readable stream of data.

Options include:

``` js
{
  start: 0, // read from this index
  end: feed.length, // read until this index
  snapshot: true, // if set to false it will update `end` to `feed.length` on every read
  tail: false, // sets `start` to `feed.length`
  live: false, // set to true to keep reading forever
  timeout: 0, // timeout for each data event (0 means no timeout)
  wait: true // wait for data to be downloaded
}
```

#### `var stream = feed.createWriteStream()`

Create a writable stream.

#### `await feed.close()`

Fully close this feed.
If you loaded this feed more than once, `close` will be a noop until all handles have invoked it.

Calls the callback with `(err)` when all storage has been closed.

#### `await feed.destroyStorage()`

Closes the feed and deletes all of it's data from storage.

#### `const {valid, invalid} = await feed.audit()`

Audit all data in the feed. Will check that all current data stored
matches the hashes in the merkle tree and clear the bitfield if not.

When done a report is passed to the callback that looks like this:

```js
{
  valid: 10, // how many data blocks matches the hashes
  invalid: 0, // how many did not
}
```

If a block does not match the hash it is cleared from the data bitfield.

#### `const extension = feed.registerExtension(name, handlers)`

Listens on extension messages of type `name` on the feeds replication channels.

- `handlers.encoding`: The encoding to use for messages. `json`, `binary`, 'utf8'
- `handlers.onmessage(message, peer)`: Function to invoke when a peer sends you a message for this extension type.
- `handlers.onerror(err, peer)`: Function to invoke when a peer has sent you a mis-coded message on this extension.

You can respond to messages with `extension.send(message, peer)`.
You can also broadcast out messages to all peers with `extension.broadcast(message)`

#### `feed.writable`

Can we append to this feed?

Populated after `ready` has been emitted. Will be `false` before the event.

#### `feed.readable`

Can we read from this feed? After closing a feed this will be false.

Populated after `ready` has been emitted. Will be `false` before the event.

#### `feed.key`

Buffer containing the public key identifying this feed.

Populated after `ready` has been emitted. Will be `null` before the event.

#### `feed.discoveryKey`

Buffer containing a key derived from the feed.key.
In contrast to `feed.key` this key does not allow you to verify the data but can be used to announce or look for peers that are sharing the same feed, without leaking the feed key.

Populated after `ready` has been emitted. Will be `null` before the event.

#### `feed.length`

How many blocks of data are available on this feed?

Populated after `ready` has been emitted. Will be `0` before the event.

#### `feed.byteLength`

How much data is available on this feed in bytes?

Populated after `ready` has been emitted. Will be `0` before the event.

#### `feed.stats`

Return per-peer and total upload/download counts.

The returned object is of the form:
```js
{
  totals: {
    uploadedBytes: 100,
    uploadedBlocks: 1,
    downloadedBytes: 0,
    downloadedBlocks: 0
  },
  peers: [
    {
      uploadedBytes: 100,
      uploadedBlocks: 1,
      downloadedBytes: 0,
      downloadedBlocks: 0
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Stats will be collected by default, but this can be disabled by setting `opts.stats` to false.

#### `feed.on('ready')`

Emitted when the feed is ready and all properties have been populated.

#### `feed.on('error', err)`

Emitted when the feed experiences a critical error.

#### `feed.on('download', index, data)`

Emitted when a data block has been downloaded.

#### `feed.on('upload', index, data)`

Emitted when a data block is uploaded.

#### `feed.on('append')`

Emitted when the feed has been appended to (i.e. has a new length / byteLength)

#### `feed.on('sync')`

Emitted every time ALL data from `0` to `feed.length` has been downloaded.

#### `feed.on('close')`

Emitted when the feed has been fully closed

#### `feed.on('peer-add', peer)`

Emitted when a new peer has started replicating with the feed.

Extension messages and metadate about the remote peer isn't ready yet.

#### `feed.on('peer-open', peer)`

Emitted when a new peer has fully connected and shared it's metadata.

You should probably prefer this over peer-add.

#### `feed.on('peer-remove', peer)`

Emitted when a peer has stopped replicating with the feed.

#### `feed.on('peer-ack', have)`

Emitted when a peer has acknowledged that it loaded some of your data.

Specify `ack: true` in the `corestoreOpts` to enable this.

You can get the `have.start` and `have.end` fields to see which portions the peer loaded. Alternately `have.bitfield` will contain the bitfield of the blocks that got loaded.

## Potential WebRTC performance enhancement

If you are finding that WebRTC connections are not reliably made, you may get improved performance by using this:

E.g. In the browser code:

  `<script src="lib/adaptor.js"></script>
  <script src="lib/hyper-sdk-bundle.js"></script>`
